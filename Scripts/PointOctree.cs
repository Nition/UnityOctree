// A Dynamic Octree for storing any objects that can be described as a single point
// See also: BoundsOctree, where objects are described by AABB bounds
// Octree:	An octree is a tree data structure which divides 3D space into smaller partitions (nodes)
//			and places objects into the appropriate nodes. This allows fast access to objects
//			in an area of interest without having to check every object.
// Dynamic: The octree grows or shrinks as required when objects as added or removed
//			It also splits and merges nodes as appropriate. There is no maximum depth.
//			Nodes have a constant - numObjectsAllowed - which sets the amount of items allowed in a node before it splits.
// T:		The content of the octree can be anything, since the bounds data is supplied separately.
