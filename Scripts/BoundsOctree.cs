// A Dynamic, Loose Octree for storing any objects that can be described with AABB bounds
// See also: PointOctree, where objects are stored as single points and some code can be simplified
// Octree:	An octree is a tree data structure which divides 3D space into smaller partitions (nodes)
//			and places objects into the appropriate nodes. This allows fast access to objects
//			in an area of interest without having to check every object.
// Dynamic: The octree grows or shrinks as required when objects as added or removed
//			It also splits and merges nodes as appropriate. There is no maximum depth.
//			Nodes have a constant - numObjectsAllowed - which sets the amount of items allowed in a node before it splits.
// Loose:	The octree's nodes can be larger than 1/2 their parent's length and width, so they overlap to some extent.
//			This can alleviate the problem of even tiny objects ending up in large nodes if they're near boundaries.
//			A looseness value of 1.0 will make it a "normal" octree.
// T:		The content of the octree can be anything, since the bounds data is supplied separately.
